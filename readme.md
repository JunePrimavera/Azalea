# Azalea

June's standard libraries for rust projects.

Has a lot of common code that is often important, or copied to many places in a project. Only works on unix systems - Windows is unsupported. No I am not supporting it.

There is a lot of random stuff in this - Some of it may or may not be useful to others in the future. I often push breaking updates - Once you're settled on a specific version I  would not advise updating. Stuff may be missing or changed behaviour. It's designed to be rather simple, not too much too it.
